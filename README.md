# The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly
This project uses the number of articles containing certain terms to
show how the conversation in The New York Times (NYT) changed following
the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Just like the characters in Clint
Eastwood’s famous spaghetti western, the election elicited rhetoric
indicating good (a heightened national belonging for many (albeit mostly
white) citizens), bad (political polarization), and ugly (social
discrimination) aspects of Trump’s America.
