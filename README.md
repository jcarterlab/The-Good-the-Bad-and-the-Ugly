# The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly
This project uses the number of articles containing certain terms to
show how the conversation in The New York Times (NYT) changed following
the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Just like the characters in Clint
Eastwoodâ€™s famous spaghetti western, Trump's rise highlighted good 
(a heightened national belonging for many (albeit mostly white) 
Americans), bad (political polarization), and ugly (social
discrimination) characteristics of US society.
