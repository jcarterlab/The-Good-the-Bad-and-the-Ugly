# The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly
This project uses a z-score transformation on the number of articles containing certain terms to show how the conversation in the world’s most famous newspaper, The New York Times (NYT), changed following the 2016 election of Donald Trump. Just like the characters in Clint Eastwood’s The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, Trump's election elicited rhetoric indicating good (a heightened sense of national belonging for many (albeit predominantly white) Americans), bad (increasing political polarization), and ugly (growing social discrimination) changes in American society.
